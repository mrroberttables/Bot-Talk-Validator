- Testing
- Variables with numbers
    - Validator could also notify the user if it only sees one occurrence of #variable[integer]#, but that's less important since the bot talk would work regardless.
- Nested Pauses/Delays
- Autofill - contentEditable
- Syntax highligting


  
-Should I catch and notify of #xxxx or xxxx# as potential variables, may be mistaken if they are typing a #toobyJokes 
-Should I catch and notify of <xxxx </xxxx or xxxxx> as potentical commands, may already be okay with how nesting/matching is done
-Check regex matching of variables and commands
  - Ignore whitespace?
